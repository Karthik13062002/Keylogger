# Keylogger

## Description

This project is a simple keylogger built using `Node.js`.  It listens for global keyboard events and logs all the keyboard and mouse strokes to a file. The keystrokes are formatted to distinguish between alphanumeric characters, special keys and modifier keys ( Alt , Shift , Backspace etc. )

## Instructions to use 
1. Go to main directory and run `npm install`. This will install all the dependencies listed in package.json.
2. Run the `script.js` file. It will start the keylogging.
3. When done press `CTRL + C` to stop the keylogging. 
4. Recorded strokes will be saved in main project directory with file name stamped with date and time. You will be able to see the output file name in the terminal.
